Sprint Notebooks
================

Various Jupyter notebooks from JWST DADF sprints.

This work is driven by the JWST Data Analysis Development Forum at the
`Space Telescope Science Institute <http://www.stsci.edu/>`_.

This repository is basically testing and work in progress. 

To aid in tracking down problems if someone else tries to run the
notebook, please put some comments about version numbers at the bottom of 
the notebook. For example:

```
# Version info
import sys
import astropy
import scipy
print "Versions:"
print "python: ",sys.version_info
print "astropy: ",astropy.__version__
print "scipy: ",scipy.__version__
```
